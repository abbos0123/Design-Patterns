# Design Patterns 

In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

- Creational design patterns - these  patterns are all about creating objects. Io other words this design patterns are used for instantiation of objects. 
- Structural design patterns - these design patterns for composition of objects and classes. With Structural design patterns use inheritnace to compose interfaces.
- Behavioral design patterns - these patterns all about communication of objects of classes. BDPs conserned mostly about communication of objects of spesific classes. 

|Creational Design Patterns|Structural Design Patterns| Behavioral Design Patterns|
|---|----|----|
|Abstract Factory| Adapter | Chain of responsibility |
|Builder| Bridge | Command|
|Factory Method| Composite | Interpreter |
|Object Pool| Decorator | Mediator|
|Prototype| Facade | Memento |
|Singleton| flyweight | Null Object |
|| Private Class Data | Observer|
| | Proxy | State |
| |  | Strategy|
| |  | Template Method |
| |  | Visitor |
